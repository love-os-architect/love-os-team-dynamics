## 🌌 Overview

The **Love-OS Team Compressor** is a specialized diagnostic engine that distills complex N-body organizational dynamics into **minimal viable signals**.

Unlike standard analytics tools, this kernel applies the **"Physics of Awakening"** to calculate the gravitational stability of a team. It performs real-time destructive stress testing to identify hidden risks like "Resistance Spikes" or "Gravitational Collapse."

## 📐 The 3-Layer Compression Architecture

We compress 170TB of human context into a lightweight JSON payload (< 5KB) for real-time decision making.

### Layer 1: Executive 1-Pager (Decision)
A single text summary for leaders.
- **TGI (Team Gravity Index):** The fundamental "health score" of the cluster.
- **Top Risk:** Identifies the single most dangerous failure mode.

### Layer 2: Resilience Triplet (Metrics)
Three sensitivity metrics tracking the team's fragility:
1.  **R-Sensitivity:** Vulnerability to ego/stress spikes.
2.  **Exit-Sensitivity:** Vulnerability to key person departure.
3.  **Edge-Sensitivity:** Vulnerability to relationship conflicts.

### Layer 3: Lightweight JSON (System)
A minimal payload for mobile/edge integration.
- **Node Compression:** Stores only state parameters ($L, V, R, G$).
- **Edge Pruning:** Retains only the top edges contributing to 90% of Binding Energy ($K$).

## 🔐 Ethical Guidelines & Access

This system is designed to **reduce organizational friction ($R$)** and **maximize integration ($L$)**.
It must **NOT** be used for:
- Surveillance or micromanagement.
- Manipulative psychological targeting.

### How to Request Access
We provide this kernel as a **Hosted API** or **Private Module** for:
- DAO / Teal Organization Architects
- AI Alignment Researchers
- Mental Health Tech Innovators

If you are building a system that requires "Mechanical Empathy," please contact the repository owner directly.
